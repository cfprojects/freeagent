=================================
*****    Application CFC    *****
=================================

The components in this directory are helpers that extend 
the functionality of various framework Application.cfc 
components. Each is an alternative to the extends attribute 
in your application skeleton. These components are entirely 
optional. The only real requirement for FreeAgent is that 
you instantiate freeagent.cfc when the application starts 
and attach your application containers to it. As long as 
that requirement is satisfied, these CFCs aren't necessary. 
These components do however help to simplify the Application.cfc 
components in the /sample and /skeleton directories, making 
it easier to see the relevant code that needs to be changed 
to install a FreeAgent application into your framework of choice.
